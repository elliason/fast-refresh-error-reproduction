#### Past Dates Only

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Future} />

### Custom Variant

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Custom} />
## Customization Options
#### Button Customization
The `buttonProps` prop allows you to pass custom properties to the button, such as `variant`, `size`, and more. You can also use the `Icon` prop to display a custom icon inside the button.

#### Locale Support

You can easily change the locale used for date formatting by passing a different locale to the `language` prop. The default locale is Czech (`cs`), but you can switch to any other locale supported by `date-fns`.

#### Calendar Customization

The `calendarProps` prop enables you to set additional properties on the calendar component, such as limiting the selectable date range using the `fromDate` and `toDate` props.

## Advanced Features

#### Force Calendar to Stay Open

If you need the calendar popover to stay open regardless of user interactions, you can use the `forceOpen` prop. This is useful in cases where you want the date picker to be persistently visible.

### Conclusion

The `DatePicker` component is a powerful tool for adding date selection functionality to your application. With its wide range of customization options, you can tailor it to fit your specific needs. Whether you need basic date selection or more advanced features like custom icons, locale support, or date range constraints, the `DatePicker` has you covered.
