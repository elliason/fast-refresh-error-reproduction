import { Canvas, Controls, Description, Meta, Primary, Stories, Title } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as LoaderStories from './loader.stories';

<Meta of={LoaderStories} name="Docs" />

<Title />
<Description />

For the Loader component to work properly, you need to define the appropriate animations in the application theme. Inspiration can be e.g. the [CSSLoaders](https://css-loaders.com/) website.

`import {Loader} from "@mf/ui/components/loader; `

<Controls />

<Stories />
