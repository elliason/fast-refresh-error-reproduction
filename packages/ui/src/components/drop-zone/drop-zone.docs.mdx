### Usage

`DropZone` is a wrapper component which wraps the file inputing logic. It has four child components. They are:

-   `DropArea`: This component is used to provide a drag and drop area for files to be uploaded. It can have any content inside it.
-   `DropedFilesDashboard`: This component is used to show the files which are uploaded successfully. It shows the file name and a delete button to remove the file. This component is not required to be used, can be replaced by own inplementation.
-   `ErrorMessages`: This component is used to show the error messages if any file upload fails. This component is not required to be used, can be replaced by own inplementation.
-   `DropZoneFooter`: This component is used to show the submit and cancel buttons. This component is not required to be used, can be replaced by own inplementation.

```jsx
import { DropArea, DropedFilesDashboard, DropZone, ErrorMessages } from '#components/drop-zone';

<DropZone url="mock-endpoint">
    <DropArea>Any content can be placed here</DropArea>
    <DropedFilesDashboard />
    <ErrorMessages />
</DropZone>;
```

### Default example

<Canvas of={DropZoneStories.Default} />

### Accept Only Specific Types Of Files

The `accept` parameter is used to specify what type of file the user can upload.

The input value of the parameter is an object in the following format `accept = { 'image/png': ['.png'] }`.

<Canvas of={DropZoneStories.AcceptOnlySpecificTypesOfFiles} />

### Custom Validation

By providing `validator` prop you can specify custom validation for files.

The value must be a function that accepts `File` object and returns `null` if file should be accepted or error object/array of error objects `type DropZoneFilesError` exported from `@mf/ui/components/drop-zone` if file should be rejected.

<Source of={DropZoneStories.CustomValidation} />

### ErrorMessages component

The `DropZone` component provides a basic way to display errors. The `ErrorMessages` component is used for this purpose and is always used as a `child` of the `DropZone` component. The `DropZone` itself passes the `ErrorMessages` component the information to display.

If you want to take advantage of the custom error management options, see the example below.

### Custom error

Sample custom error message for when the user uploads a file larger than 1 bytes. The `onDropRejected` props was used for the sample, which receives a callback function `(files) => setRejectedFiles(files)`, which causes the program to receive an error message field. These notifications are then rendered by the `Toaster` component and by using `useToast()` hook.
