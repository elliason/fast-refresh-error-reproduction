File upload is an xtension of DropZone component. Sharing the same props except `url`, `onUploadAccepted` and `onUploadRejected`. When uploading a file via FileUpload the file constraints are first checked on DropZone side, then on the server side. If the file is successfuly dropped on both sides, it is added to the list of uploaded files and confirmation callback is called. Therefore the upload request is called immediately after the files are passed to the input. For sending files to the endpoint after a submit it is advised to use DropZone component and implement custom file sending logic in its `onSubmitted` callback.

```jsx
import { DropArea, DropedFilesDashboard, ErrorMessages, FileUpload } from '#components/file-upload';
```

### Usage

`FileUpload` is a wrapper component which wraps the file upload process. It has three child components. They are:

-   `DropArea`: This component is used to provide a drag and drop area for files to be uploaded. It can have any content inside it.
-   `DropedFilesDashboard`: This component is used to show the files which are uploaded successfully. It shows the file name and a delete button to remove the file. This component is not required to be used, can be replaced by own inplementation.
-   `ErrorMessages`: This component is used to show the error messages if any file upload fails. This component is not required to be used, can be replaced by own inplementation.

```jsx
import { DropArea, DropedFilesDashboard, ErrorMessages, FileUpload } from '#components/file-upload';

<FileUpload url="mock-endpoint">
    <DropArea>Any content can be placed here</DropArea>
    <DropedFilesDashboard />
    <ErrorMessages />
</FileUpload>;
```
