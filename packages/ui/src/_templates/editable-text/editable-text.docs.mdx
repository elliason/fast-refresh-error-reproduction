WE NEED DISABLED TEXTAREA TO CALCULATE THE HEIGHT BASED ON THE CONTENT

ONCE THE EDIT BUTTON IS CLICKED, THE TEXTAREA SHOULD BECOME ENABLED AND THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE TEXTAREA AGAIN. THIS WAY WE CAN SEE THE FIELD WAS EDITED.

```jsx import {Pencil} from 'lucide-react'; import {Button} from '@mf/ui/components/button'; import {
    (Card, CardContent)
} from '@mf/ui/components/card'; import {(Description, Field, Form, Input, Label, Message)} from '@mf/ui/components/form';
import {Textarea} from '../../textarea'; ```
<Controls />
